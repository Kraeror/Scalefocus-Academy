# Scalefocus-Academy
Worked in a team of five people to build a manager for a bank as our final project for the Scalefocus Academy.
We developed a Spring WEB API using Spring Boot, Mockito and Junit for testing and Postman for presenting the project.
The available functionalities were: creating an account, deposit and withdrawal to your account and transfering funds to another accounts. 
We built a system for loans including a loan calculator.
